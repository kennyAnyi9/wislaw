# WISLAW EDUCATION AND SUPPORT FUND 

Wislaw Education and Support Fund, founded in 2007 is a development and social enterprise-oriented organisation based in Nsuta-Tarkwa, in the Western region of Ghana. We aim to build skilled youth as agents of change in their communities by equipping them with the necessary skills and funds they require to leverage the unique opportunities present in Ghana and Africa. We achieve this through capacity building, financing, providing opportunities for networking, access to the market, learning & development, Coaching, Mentoring & internships, and providing insightful and reliable information.
